Using Third Party API to construct a weather dashboard


# User Story:
As a traveler, I desire access to weather forecasts for multiple cities to assist me in planning my trips more effectively.

# Acceptance Criteria:

Given a weather dashboard equipped with form inputs,
When I search for a city,
Then I should be presented with both current and upcoming weather conditions for that city, and the city should be added to my search history.
When I inspect the current weather conditions for a city,
Then I should see details such as the city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
When I examine the future weather conditions for a city,
Then I should find a 5-day forecast that includes the date, an icon symbolizing the weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
When I click on a city within the search history,
Then I should once again be shown both current and future weather conditions for that city, facilitating the creation of a GitHub readme.
